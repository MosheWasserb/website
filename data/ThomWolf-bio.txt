Thomas Wolf lead the Science Team at Huggingface Inc., a Brooklyn-based startup working on Natural Language Generation and Natural Language Understanding. He has been programming since I was 12, writing video games in Assembly and C/C++ when his friends were playing them. But his first carrier was actually in Physics rather than Computer Science. After graduating from French Ecole Polytechnique, He went to Berkeley to do research on laser-plasma interactions before starting a PhD in Statistical/Quantum physics in Paris, working on superconducting materials for the French DARPA (DGA) and Thales. After his PhD, He wanted to move from the long time scale of experiments in quantum physics and ended up totally changing way. He got a law degree from Paris Sorbonne University and worked as a European Patent Attorney for 5 years helping a portfolio of startups and big companies to build and defend their Intellectual Property assets. In 2015/2016, he was consulting for a Deep Learning startups that made him discover the field of ML/AI. He quickly realised that most of the maths actually came from statistical physics and progressively felt in love with Machine Learning. One of his friend asked him if he wanted to join a Brooklyn-based startup, and there he was, doing science again and having a lot of fun!
